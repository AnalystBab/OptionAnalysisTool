# CURSOR RULES FOR INDIAN OPTION ANALYSIS TOOL PROJECT

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY FIRST STEP FOR EVERY AI SESSION
**ALWAYS** read `APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md` before starting any task.
This file contains complete project specifications, current status, and task priorities.

## PROJECT CONTEXT
- **Project**: Indian Option Market Analysis Tool
- **Market Focus**: Index Options Only (Indian Market) 
- **Primary Purpose**: Circuit Limit Tracking and Analysis
- **Data Source**: Kite Connect API
- **Market Hours**: 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM (Pre-open: 9:00-9:15 AM)

## DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL
1. **STOP AND SEARCH FIRST:**
   - Use grep_search to find existing references
   - Use file_search to find related files  
   - Use list_dir to understand directory structure
   - DO NOT CREATE DUPLICATE CODE
   - ALWAYS CHECK WHETHER CODE ALREADY EXISTS IN CODEBASE

2. **VERIFY BEFORE CHANGING:**
   - Confirm if file exists
   - Check for similar functionality
   - Validate namespace and location
   - Do not modify centralized package files without consent
   - Both domain application layers compiled successfully - get consent before changes

3. **API CLIENT RESTRICTIONS:**
   - Do not modify auto-generated files from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
   - Interface defines contract between client and server
   - Changes should be made to API/backend first, then regenerate client interface
   - Manual modifications to generated files cause inconsistencies

## CORE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY
1. **Application Timing**: Start 9 AM, ready by 9:15 AM
2. **Intraday Tracking**: Real-time circuit limit monitoring with timestamps
3. **EOD Processing**: Merge intraday circuit data with Kite EOD data
4. **Historical Queries**: View circuit limit changes for any date/strike

## TASK WORKFLOW
1. âœ… Check `APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md` 
2. âœ… Update task tracking section with current task
3. âœ… Search existing codebase to prevent duplication
4. âœ… Implement changes following documented approach
5. âœ… Update progress status after completion
6. âœ… Commit changes with descriptive messages

## PROHIBITED ACTIONS
- Never create duplicate functionality
- Never modify auto-generated API client files
- Never change centralized package files without explicit consent
- Never create temporary files for iteration
- Never deviate from common approach for images folder organization

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
1. **HIGH**: Real-time circuit limit monitoring service
2. **HIGH**: Database schema for circuit limit tracking  
3. **MEDIUM**: Application startup automation
4. **MEDIUM**: EOD data processing pipeline
5. **LOW**: Historical data query interface

## COMMUNICATION RULES
- Always explain what you're doing in natural language
- Get confirmation before major architectural changes
- Document findings and show existing related files
- Explain needed changes before implementation
