## Project Overview
**Indian Option Market Analysis Tool**
- **Market Focus**: Index Options Only (Indian Market)
- **Primary Purpose**: Circuit Limit Tracking and Analysis
- **Data Source**: Kite Connect API

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. APPLICATION TIMING & STARTUP
- **Application Start**: 9:00 AM (Pre-open session)
- **Ready State**: 9:15 AM (Market open)
- **Operation**: Continuous data collection during market hours
- **Post-Market**: Data consolidation and storage

### 2. INTRADAY CIRCUIT LIMIT TRACKING
**Real-time Monitoring Requirements:**
- Monitor circuit limit changes for all index option strikes
- Record every circuit limit change with:
  - Date & Time (precise timestamp)
  - Strike Price
  - Contract Details (Symbol, Expiry)
  - Old Circuit Limit Value
  - New Circuit Limit Value
  - Index Level at time of change
  - Other relevant market data

### 3. END-OF-DAY (EOD) DATA PROCESSING
**Post-Market Operations:**
- Collect EOD data from Kite Connect
- **Issue**: Kite EOD data may not include circuit limits
- **Solution**: Merge intraday circuit limit data with EOD data
- Store consolidated data for historical analysis

### 4. HISTORICAL DATA RETRIEVAL
**Query Requirements:**
- View circuit limit changes for any specific date
- Filter by index contract strikes
- Display complete circuit limit change history
- Show all tracker values for selected timeframe
